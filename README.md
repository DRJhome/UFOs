Summary
Drawback:

There are a few drawbacks with this website.
1.	The City filter only works if you type the city in lower case text.
2.	The Filters would be easier for the user if they had a drop-down list function.
3.	The data only shows UFO sightings for the US
4.	The date filter only allows you to select by the date. It would be better if you can select by the month.
